CHANGELOG 
08 March 2023:

Added CSV code extension VS Code Rainbow in order to be able to deal w csv files & see them in diff colors,

Added extension Theme By Language for to see csv files in a diff color theme (one that shows off the data colors) than my standard theme (also changed)
  - This extension forces a file settings.json in .vscode folder of every project
  - The file does not override the standard vscode settings.json located in C:\Users\Potato\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json but adds to it .. 

Global settings file C:\Users\Potato\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json changes:
  - plaintext files got a standard font size (yes it does change on zoom)
  - ditto no autoindent, linenumbers, renderwhitespace etc etc just wanted txt files to LIVE on their own
